# shopping-app
shopping app - at bill counter
-------------------------------------------------
New retail customer choose to use your shopping app. They provide below 3 requirements. 
The task is to implement them and ensure using testcases that it works.

1. Add item to the bill using only the bar code as a parameter
 - Items added one by one, multiple calls as it only takes the bar code
2. Remove the item from the bill using only the bar code as parameter
 -Again multiple removals require multiple calls
3. A summary of the bill, looking like :

   3 x Apple @ 1.30 = 3.90
   3 x Lemon @ 1.60 = 4.80
   3 x Mango @ 0.99 = 2.97
   Total = 11.67

--------------------------------------------
This is the sample data that must be used in the exercise, although incorporated any way candidate thinks is best :

01001|Lemon|1.60
01002|Apple|1.30
01003|Mango|0.99

Objective is not to create a program, but to create the code and prove that it works. 
Time limit - 1 hour.
